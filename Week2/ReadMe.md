ReadMe – Learning Outcome

In Week 2 of my web development internship, I focused on learning how to style web pages using CSS. This week helped me understand how presentation is separated from structure and how design transforms a basic HTML page into a visually appealing layout.

Here are the learning outcomes for this week:

Understanding How CSS Works
I learned the three ways to apply CSS: inline, internal, and external stylesheets, and when each method is used.

Learning Core Styling Concepts
I explored colors, fonts, background styling, margins, paddings, borders, shadows, and general text formatting.

Understanding the CSS Box Model
I learned how content, padding, border, and margin work together to form the box model.

Experimenting With Layout & Positioning
I practiced using position, display, float, flexbox, and other layout techniques.

Styling My Week 1 Webpage
I applied CSS to my Personal Info webpage to make it colorful, clean, structured, and visually pleasing.

Building Confidence in Website Design
By the end of the week, I felt more confident using CSS to control the look and layout of a webpage.
