Week 4 – Introduction to JavaScript

ReadMe – Learning Outcomes (Written by Hassan)

In Week 4 of my web development internship, I started learning JavaScript to make my websites interactive. JavaScript allows webpages to respond to user actions and dynamic changes.

Here are the learning outcomes for this week:

Understanding JavaScript Basics
I learned about variables, arrays, conditionals (if, else), loops, and functions.

Learning DOM Manipulation
I practiced selecting HTML elements, changing text content, colors, and styles dynamically.

Responding to User Events
I learned how to use event listeners and button clicks to respond to user actions.

Adding Interactivity to My Website
I added buttons that change the website theme, show alerts, and update text content dynamically.

Building Programming Confidence
By the end of the week, I became more confident in writing JavaScript and linking it with HTML and CSS.
