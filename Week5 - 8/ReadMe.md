Week 5–8 – Final Project: To-Do List Web Application

ReadMe – Learning Outcomes (Written by Hassan)

In Weeks 5 to 8 of my web development internship, I worked on my final project: a To-Do List Web Application. This project allowed me to combine everything I learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a fully functional, interactive website with a clean and user-friendly design.

Here are the learning outcomes for this project:

Planning and Designing the Project
I designed the layout of the To-Do List, including proper spacing, color scheme, and responsive structure.

Developing HTML Structure
I created the main structure of the website, including input fields, task list container, and action buttons.

Styling with CSS
I applied styles to make the website visually appealing, added spacing between elements, hover effects, rounded corners, shadows, and responsive layout.

Adding JavaScript Functionality
I implemented core features: adding tasks, deleting tasks, marking tasks as complete, updating task count, and changing colors dynamically.

Testing and Debugging
I tested the website for responsiveness and functionality across different screen sizes, ensuring a polished user experience.

Hosting and Presentation
I hosted the project online using GitHub Pages and prepared a short presentation explaining the features and design choices of the project.
