Week 1 – – Learning Outcome

In Week 1 of my web development internship, I learned the fundamental concepts of how the web works and how HTML is used to build webpages.
Here are the key things I learned this week:

Understanding How the Web Works
I learned about the role of the browser, client, and server, and how an HTML file is loaded and displayed on the web.

Basic HTML Structure
I understood the purpose of tags, attributes, and how different elements are written inside an HTML document.

Using Essential HTML Tags
I practiced using headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists. I also learned how to add attributes like src, alt, and href.

Creating My First Webpage
I created a “Personal Info” webpage using all the tags I learned. This helped me understand how to structure content properly.

Gaining Confidence in Writing HTML
By completing the mini project, I became more comfortable writing HTML code and building simple pages on my own.
