ReadMe – Learning Outcomes

In Week 3 of my web development internship, I focused on making websites responsive so that they look good on any device, from desktops to mobile phones. I also learned modern layout techniques using Flexbox and Grid.

Here are the learning outcomes for this week:

I practiced using Flexbox for flexible row and column layouts and Grid for more complex page designs.

Applying Media Queries
I learned how to use CSS media queries to change styles based on screen width.

Creating a Multi-Page Mini Website
I built a 3-page website with Home, About, and Contact pages. Each page adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

I practiced combining layout, color schemes, and typography to create a visually pleasing and professional look.

Building Confidence in Professional Web Design
By the end of the week, I felt confident creating multi-page responsive websites.
